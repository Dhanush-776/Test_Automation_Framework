Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Dhanush-776/Test_Automation_Framework.git
cd <Test_Automation_Framework>


Running Tests
Run Tests on LambdaTest
mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false

Run Tests on Local Machine in Headless Mode
mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true


Reports & Logs
Reports
After execution, test results will be generated in the form of execution output and logs.
(Reporting tools can be integrated as an enhancement if required.)
Logs
Logs are created during test execution to help with debugging and analysis.

Parallel Execution
Parallel execution is handled using TestNG configuration, allowing tests to run faster by utilizing multiple threads.

CI/CD Ready
This framework is suitable for execution in CI/CD pipelines such as:

Jenkins
GitHub Actions
Azure DevOps

Headless execution makes it ideal for automated pipeline runs.
